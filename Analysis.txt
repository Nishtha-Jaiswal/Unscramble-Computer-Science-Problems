                                              TIME COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS
Task0:

As the statements/line of codes are simple and not involving any branching or loop so it will take constant time for execution. Let the constant time be 1

Time complexity=O(1)


Task1:

The time taken by the for loop will depend o the number of inputs, so let there are n number of inputs for each for loop,this gives the time complexity as O(n).And also that the time complexity of conversion of a list to a set also takes time O(n) (since if the list has n elements so iterating over the list will take O(n) time and adding the element to the hash table will take constant time ie O(1)).

Time complexity=O(n) 


Task2:

The time taken by the for loop will depend o the number of inputs, so let there are n number of inputs for each for loop (because the time taken by the if condition is O(1) ). Since there is nesting of for loop ( for the evaluation of the unique_list that stores unique numbers) so the time complexity of each for loop will be multiplied.

Time complexity=O(n^2) 


Task3:

The time taken by the for loop will depend o the number of inputs, so let there are n number of inputs for each for loop (because the time taken by the if ondition is O(1) ). Since there is nesting of for loop ( for the evaluation of the unique_list that stores unique numbers) so the time complexity of each for loop will be multiplied.

Time complexity=O(n^2) 


Task4:

The time taken by the for loop will depend o the number of inputs, so let there are n number of inputs for each for loop (because the time taken by the if ondition is O(1) ). Since there is nesting of for loop ( for the evaluation of the unique_list that stores unique numbers) so the time complexity of each for loop will be multiplied.

Time complexity=O(n^2)
